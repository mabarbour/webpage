My research program seeks to understand the feedback between evolutionary processes and ecological networks, and its consequences for biodiversity. To do this, I complement rigorous field observations and experiments with mathematical modelling and analyses of global datasets on species interactions. My current and future work uses these approaches to study networks of interactions between plants, herbivorous insects, and their parasitoids, whose feeding interactions regulate much of Earthâ€™s biodiversity. By integrating eco-evolutionary dynamics into food webs, the goal of my research program is to put us in a more informed position to conserve ecological communities in the face of environmental change.
