Biology teachers are in a powerful position to instil an understanding and appreciation of biodiversity in both future scientists and non-scientists. My approach to teaching biology employs activity-based and enquiry-based learning to develop creativity and critical thinking skills. To achieve this, I use a variety of teaching techniques to engage students with different abilities, interests, and ways of learning. I have developed this philosophy based on my experience as a teacher and mentor, by reflecting on my experiences as a student, and through professional development training.
