abstract = "Both body size and temperature directly influence consumer-resource dynamics. There is also widespread empirical evidence for the temperature-size rule (TSR), which creates a negative relationship between temperature and body size. However, it is not known how the TSR affects community dynamics. Here we integrate temperature- and size-dependent models to include indirect effects of warming, through changes in body size, to answer the question: How does the TSR affect the predicted response of consumer-resource systems to warming? We find that the TSR is expected to maintain consumer-resource biomass ratios and buffer the community from extinctions under warming. While our results are limited to conditions where organisms are below their thermal optimum, they hold under a range of realistic temperature-size responses and are robust to the type of functional response. Our analyses suggest that the widely observed TSR may reduce the impacts of warming on consumer-resource systems."
