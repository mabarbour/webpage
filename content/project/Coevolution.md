## Coevolution of predator-prey interactions
One of the most fundamental interactions in an ecological network is that between predators and their prey. Many prey approach, inspect, and signal toward their predators. These behaviours are thought to function as predator-deterrent signals – honest signals that indicate to a predator that continued hunting is likely to be futile. However, most studies neglect to test whether free-ranging predators respond adaptively to these signals, resulting in uncertainty as to whether coevolution is maintaining prey-signalling behaviour. I conducted systematic field observations of free-ranging rattlesnake responses to tail-flagging displays given by ground squirrels. I discovered that snakes were less likely to strike at tail-flagging squirrels because these signals honestly advertise a squirrel's readiness to dodge an attack. Moreover, rattlesnakes abandoned ambush sites soon after receiving tail-flag displays because these displays simultaneously signalled the snake’s presence to nearby squirrels, thereby reducing the probability of a snake capturing nearby prey. By demonstrating the adaptive response of rattlesnakes to tail-flag displays, my work provides one of the best empirical examples of coevolution maintaining predator-deterrent signals [(Barbour and Clark 2012)](/pdf/Barbour_2012-Proc_B.pdf).{{< youtube RIaRZivDdwk >}}

## Ecological character displacement and community stability
The coevolutionary process is thought to be a primary driver of Earth's biodiversity. Because of this, coevolution is commonly thought to be a potent stabilizing force in species interactions. For example, the coevolution of competitors often leads to niche partitioning and character displacement, thereby promoting coexistence between competitors. Using a mathematical model, I discovered that ecological character displacement could hinder species coexistence when the dynamics of both consumers and resources are taken into account (Barbour and Rudman, manuscript in prep). Character displacement destabilizes the community because selection favours consumers that are more efficient at exploiting resources, which dominates the stabilizing effects of niche partitioning. This result overturns traditional thinking that character displacement promotes species coexistence. Furthermore, these modelling results are supported by empirical data of consumer-resource interactions from one of the most well-studied examples of ecological character displacement (threespine stickleback). Ultimately, this suggests that coevolutionary processes may not always lead to increased community stability, as is often assumed, and therefore future research is warranted.
