From a practical standpoint, it is much easier to survey the diversity and composition of species, rather than the strength and organization of species interactions. However, it is difficult to predict community dynamics unless the network structure of species interactions is known. Therefore, it is critical that we develop phylogenetic and trait-based models to be able to predict the structure of species interactions for any given community. Predictive models have been developed to some extent for aquatic food webs, where body size is a key determinant of trophic interactions. Body size, however, is much less important for the parasitic interactions that characterize plant-herbivore-parasitoid networks. Taking advantage of a global dataset on insect herbivore-parasitoid interactions (14,184 species interactions, Figure 1), I am developing a predictive model for this ecological network based on the phylogeny and functional traits of both herbivores and parasitoids. {{< figure src="/img/prey_pred_openord.png" title="Network of feeding interactions between 5,556 parasitoid (black dots) and 2,210 herbivore (blue dots) species." >}}
