## Intraspecific genetic variation $\Rightarrow$ Network Structure
Network theory has provided a quantitative approach for predicting how the gain or loss of species will affect the structure and dynamics of ecological communities. Representing a network at the species level, however, makes the implicit assumption that each species consists of a homogenous population of individuals, all of which interact equally with individuals of different species. Since genetic and phenotypic variation is a characteristic of virtually all wild populations, there is a clear need to test whether heritable trait variation scales up to affect network structure. Using a common garden experiment, quantitative genetics, and a computer simulation, I discovered that different host-plant genotypes supported unique compositions of herbivore species [(Barbour et al. 2015)]({{< ref "publication/func_ecol_2015.md" >}}) and herbivore-parasitoid interactions, resulting in a 20% increase in food-web complexity over the range of genetic variation in the host-plant population [(Barbour et al. 2016)]({{< ref "publication/pnas_2016.md" >}}). My study provided the first evidence that intraspecific genetic variation is capable of increasing network complexity. Given that network complexity is known to buffer ecological communities from perturbations, my research predicts that processes that alter genetic variation within a population (e.g. natural selection, genetic drift, gene flow, and mutation) will affect the persistence of communities in the face of environmental change. To test this prediction, I am currently initiating lab experiments using model communities of Arabidopsis thaliana, four species of aphids, and two species of parasitic wasps, at the University of Zurich.

## Network structure $\Rightarrow$ Intraspecific Genetic Variation
While there is a long-standing history of research testing the effects of ecological conditions on evolution, these studies have usually been limited to a single species or pair of interacting species. Consequently, we have a limited understanding of how community structure affects the direction and magnitude of selection on functional traits. Given that the loss of biodiversity is simplifying the structure of ecological networks, there is a pressing need to be able to predict how network structure affects evolutionary processes. To begin to understand the relationship between network structure and natural selection, I conducted a field experiment and showed that reducing food-web complexity actually increased the strength and number of traits under selection for a herbivorous insect [(Barbour et al., ESA conference 2015)](https://figshare.com/articles/Food_web_complexity_reduces_variation_in_herbivore_fitness_among_host_plant_genotypes/1525124). At University of Zurich, I will be conducting lab experiments to explicitly examine how network structure shapes patterns of genetic variation and natural selection on Arabidopsis.
